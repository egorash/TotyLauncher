# TotyLauncher

*Scottish: tiny, very small
Aw, look at that toty wee baby hedgehog!* 
-- [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Toty)

Influenced by [NoPhone](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/nophone-2), TotyLauncher is designed to make your phone as simple and non-intrusive as possible.

By reducing your home screen to a small, unexciting list of words, rather than the day-glo icons that come out of the box with Android, hopefully TotyLauncher can help you become a little less enamoured with your phone throughout the day.
